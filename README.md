## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Guilherme Marques

On this Github I present projects developed from public data, with resolutions of business problems using Data Science concepts and tools. 

You can also see my portfolio here : https://guilhermemarquesss.github.io/Portfolio/

## About me ðŸš€

I have 10 years of professional experience in administrative area. I am an enthusiast for Data Science and believe data analysis will influence more and more the decision-making of companies and leaders, regardless of their area of expertise.

My professional goal is to make a career change to the Data Science area. Combining this career transition with my experience, I intend to develop creative and sustainable solutions through the use of data, which allows for assertive decision-making and positively reflects on the company's results.
